# MRMCDCTF2018: Observer effect

### Description:
When designing a CTF, it's normally a good idea to hold an especially hard challenge
back - just in case some really smart team solves all the other challenges, than
you can throw the 'final boss' into the ring.

In MRMCD CTF 2017, this challenge had the role of the 'final boss'.

Have fun!
