# MRMCDCTF2017: Once Upon A Time

### Description:

This is not a reversing challenge. The binary will simple print the flag.





Seriously! It will!





All you need is some patience.






And then some more patience.





And then just a little bit more patience.





And then, wait for it...





Patience!




After that, you just need to wait for a little bit.





And then, have some patience.





And then, this CTF is over.





And after that, you die.





And some time after that, the flag will be printed.





So it's very easy, in the end.
